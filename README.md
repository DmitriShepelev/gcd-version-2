## Task description ##

Design a class whose methods allow calculating the [Greatest Common Divisor](https://gitlab.com/epam-autocode-tasks/gcd.git) (GCD) using various algorithms.
- Implement [Euclid's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm) for [two](Gcd/IntegerExtensions.cs#L18), [three](Gcd/IntegerExtensions.cs#L32), [etc.](Gcd/IntegerExtensions.cs#L46) of integers. 
- Implement methods that should be able to determine the GCD calculation [time](Gcd/IntegerExtensions.cs#L104).
- Implement [Stein algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_GCD_algorithm) (Euclid's binary algorithm) for [two](Gcd/IntegerExtensions.cs#L59), [three](Gcd/IntegerExtensions.cs#L73), [etc.](Gcd/IntegerExtensions.cs#L87) of integers. 
- Develop a class that allows performing [Greatest Common Divisor](https://gitlab.com/epam-autocode-tasks/gcd.git) (GCD) computations using 
- Add to the class methods that should be able to determine the GCD calculation time. 
- Add to the class methods that implement the [Stein algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_GCD_algorithm) (Euclid's binary algorithm) to calculate GCD of two, three, etc. of integers.
- Add to the class methods that should be able to determine the GCD calculation time.
