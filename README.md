## Task description ##

- Develop a class that allows performing [Greatest Common Divisor](https://gitlab.com/epam-autocode-tasks/gcd.git) (GCD) computations using [Euclid's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm) for two, three, etc. of integers. 
- Add to the class methods that should be able to determine the GCD calculation time. 
- Add to the class methods that implement the [Stein algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_GCD_algorithm) (Euclid's binary algorithm) to calculate GCD of two, three, etc. of integers.
- Add to the class methods that should be able to determine the GCD calculation time.
